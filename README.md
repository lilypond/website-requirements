# Requirements For the GNU LilyPond Website

LilyPond's website, [lilypond.org](http://lilypond.org) is a special kind of thing as it's generation 
is deeply intertwined with the building of its documentation, and there are pretty deep and old 
(inter)dependencies.

Regularly the issue of updating the website to something more modern pops up, and regularly it fails
due to the incompatibility of a modern web designer's perspective and the specific requirements and
limitations, as well as maybe a certain type of "conservativeness" among LilyPond's developers.

In order to simplify this process and to avoid frustration we prepare this document with the aim
of providing a framework of requirements and wishes that any future incarnation of LilyPond's
website should meet. Anyone interested in working on it can then refer directly to this document
to see what may be possible and what not.
